## Assessing Comparative Importance of DNA Sequence and Epigenetic Modificationson Gene Expression using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network

Gene  expression is  regulated  at transcriptionaland  post-transcriptionallevels.  DNA sequence and epigenetic modifications are keyfactors whichregulategene transcription. Understanding their  complex  interactions  and their  respective  contributions  to  the regulation  ofgene  expression remains  a  challenge  in  biological studies.  We have developeda framework   of deep   convolutional   neural   network   to   predict   mRNA abundance usinginformation on DNA  sequencesas  well  asepigeneticmodificationswithin  genes  and  their  cis-regulatory  regions.  We  demonstrate  that  our  framework outperformsother  machine  learning  models interms  of predicting  mRNA  abundance using transcriptional and epigeneticprofilesfrom sixdistinct cell types. The analysis from the learned models also reveals that thespecific  regionsaround  promotors  and transcription termination sites are most important for the regulation ofgene expression. Using the method of Integrated Gradients, we identify narrow segments in these regions which are most likely to impactgene expression for a givenepigenetic modification. We further  showthat  these identified segmentsare  enriched  in  known active  regulatory regions  by  comparing  the  transcription  factor  binding  sites  obtained  via  ChIP-seq. Moreover, we demonstrate how iSEGnet can uncover potential transcription factors that have regulatory functions in cancerusing two cancer multi-omics data.
